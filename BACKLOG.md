# BACKLOG.md — what is built, what is not, and what we decided against

Reconciled against the code on **2026-09-28**, after the breathe pass and the 3D
view were merged. Every "not built" line below was checked against `src/`
rather than trusted from notes — because four entries in an old list were wrong
in the same direction, all claiming something was unbuilt when it had shipped.

**If you add an idea here, say who it came from and what decision it creates.**
An idea that implies no decision for the player is the one filter that has
reliably caught bad suggestions.

**Player feedback lives in `PLAYTESTS.md`** — what testers did, said and asked,
one dated section per session. Decisions that come out of it land here.

## Roadmap — the themes ahead

Updates come in THEMES rather than one idea at a time, so each one can set up
the next. Only the next few days are scheduled; the rest is order, not dates.

**Done:** the trader and its shop, traffic, naming on a controller, the flare
race, the gem of the road; the day-7 hunt's six fixes; and, merged 2026-09-28,
the breathe pass and Gabe's 3D view.

**Next: small things, then play.** See "Next up" below: the new-player fixes from
the 2026-09-26 playtest, David's background music, and the miasma.

**Then: a Dwarf Fortress direction — "which systems fit the game, and would be
fun?"** Brad, 2026-09-28. Both views only DRAW, so this is simulation work.
Start as a brainstorm, not a build. The seed of it is already here, under "The
directional one" below. One rule for everything in it: **every interaction
must leave a trace the player can SEE** — Dwarf Fortress is famously
unreadable, and our own playtest found mud's slowdown invisible until Brad
explained it. The shared effects layer means a new interaction announces an
event once and both views show it.

**The Dwarf Fortress plan (Brad and Claude, 2026-09-28).** One web, built a
strand at a time with play between:

    kill -> body -> scavenger spreads spores -> purple (miasma) / red (rises)
         -> fire burns both -> light -> monsters see more
    fleeing + chased -> pit -> next floor, wounded and vengeful
    the traveller turns all of it into gossip

1. **Bodies stay and rot. BUILT 2026-09-28**, waiting on play. The creature's
   own picture on its side (classic) or lying flat and turning with the
   camera (3D), darkening and fading over BODY_ROT = 120 turns, then gone.
   `GameState.bodies` keeps the whole creature for the later strands; one
   `BodyLook` colours it for both views; the shovel takes the body it raises.
2. **The fungus family.** Brad's additions (2026-09-28): **fire is the answer
   to the bad fungi** -- a flame weapon or fire gem burns a purple or red one
   away; the caves (4-6) trade a LITTLE green for seeded purple and red;
   monsters do NOT avoid red (walking over it tags them, and a tagged monster
   that dies rises); most avoid purple, but bats (they fly) and rats do not
   care -- rats may SEEK red and purple on purpose, the plague carriers; blood
   trails lead scavengers to bodies. One shared code path for both views.
   GREEN (as now: edible, light) grows only on its own.
   Bodies NEVER grow green -- Brad: eating a fungus that grew from a kill is
   not fun to think about -- they grow PURPLE (poison) or RED (blood), which a
   rat, bat or rabbit passing the body seeds; a few turns later the body is
   gone and the fungus stands there. New tiles APPENDED to Tiles (ints are
   saved). Rabbits eat fungus: purple sickens them, red may raise them.
   Brad's depth table: 1-2 green; 3 green and purple; 4-5 more purple than
   green; 6 red and purple, green rare; 7-9 more red than purple; 10 all
   three; the climb mirrors it. **OPEN: the caves (4-6) rely on green fungus
   as their deliberate potion replacement (CLAUDE.md) -- keep green steady
   there, or accept a harder cave on purpose.**
3. **The miasma, redesigned around purple:** ONE purple fungus is a source
   (no 2x2 group needed).
4. **Red fungus raises the dead.** It is a timer: after some turns the body it
   grew from rises -- less HP, hits harder, hunts the player (Brad: a zombie
   piloted by a fungus, The Last of Us). Burn it before it hatches (strand 6).
   **Brad, 2026-09-29: confined to the room it rose in** -- a zombie room: it
   hunts whatever is inside and never follows you out; go back in prepared, or
   stay out. Caves have no rooms: a radius round where it rose. Proposals: the
   room is readable from its doorway (drifting red spores, a red tint at the
   door); it SNOWBALLS -- whatever the gong or a patrol leads in dies and rises
   too, until someone burns it; and HATCHING TIME SCALES WITH SIZE -- a rat in
   a few turns, a dragon's body much longer, a window to burn it (Brad's red
   fungus young dragon, on floor 10: a boss-sized problem you made yourself). Brad agreed
   the size scaling ("a dragon, you have time to hide") -- and it gives the
   STEALTH play a reason. **The one exception to the room: the gong shrine.**
   Ringing it frees the risen to answer the call, like everything else in
   earshot. Shrine colours are shuffled per run, so "which colour was the
   gong?" becomes knowledge that can save or end a run.
5. **Pits as escape.** A fleeing monster lit by the player's torch several
   turns running is being chased; then a pit is an escape, not a no-go. It
   lands on the next floor wounded by the fall, awake, hunting, with a
   revenge bonus for the floor and more XP. Carried down on a "fell from
   above" list like following allies; saved with the run. Messages: "The
   kobold leaps into the pit!"; the trader: "Something fell in from above."
   Also cures fleeing monsters dying in room corners.
6. **Fire.** Flame weapons and the flare ignite fungus (a flare of light, the
   food lost), bones and wooden doors; the answer to red fungus.
Further strands from the same brainstorm, all welcome (Brad: "all of your
ideas are really good"): blood trails that scavengers follow; watchable
hunting; frost freezing water to ice; rubble cracked by force (gems); alarm-
raising kobolds; sleepers drawn to lit braziers; monsters wielding what they
find; trader gossip; a nemesis from the morgue. Every one must leave a trace
the player can SEE.

**The combat update.** Tactics in the spirit of AD&D 2nd edition.
- Creatures get a FACING (the traffic intent `Entity.want` can supply it).
  Flanking does +1; attacking from behind does +2, and the shield may not count.
  It works both ways — packs will flank you.
- Monsters that tire of waiting in a queue look for another way round, which is
  to say they learn to flank on purpose.
- Polearms: javelin (thrown), spear, halberd. They reach two squares and a hit
  passes through to a second enemy in line. Two-handed, so no shield.
  **Brad, 2026-09-28: "ranged" means three things, not one.** Today it means
  a missile in flight (bows, slings). A polearm is MELEE at two squares; a
  thrown spear is a missile again. The code will need the three kept apart --
  reach-2 melee must not go through the shooting path (no ammo, no arrows in
  flight, adjacent-and-next rules) -- and the new reach tint (below, item 5)
  is what shows a spear's two squares.

**A scroll session.** Spells, as scrolls: single-use, or charged for several
uses. More than combat. Fireball and teleport have been discussed; players have
asked for lightning bolt and invisibility (PLAYTESTS 2026-09-26).

**A new-player theme.** An intro sequence on New Game with a skip button (the
trader and why you are here; Brad writes it). The title screen itself is
BUILT (2026-09-28, see Next up 8); How to play and Artwork (a parent's
suggestion, PLAYTESTS 2026-09-26) would be two more rows on it.

---

## Next up

**1. Small fixes from the 2026-09-26 playtest** (see PLAYTESTS.md):
- **The `?` hint** in bold and colour on floors 1–2, back to normal after that or
  once the legend has been opened. Neither teen found the controls alone.
- **Terrain status:** the sidebar's `footing` line becomes a status line with an
  icon ("wading · slowed", "sinking · slowed"); it becomes the home for status
  effects (the miasma is next). Say it in the HERE box too — the Legion player
  learned the game from that box.
- **A clickable "menu" button in the sidebar, and a second menu key** browsers do
  not reserve. In browser fullscreen, Esc leaves fullscreen first; a 10-year-old
  gave up over it. Also set the itch embed smaller (for example 1280×720) — the
  game scales, the 1600-wide frame does not fit a laptop at 125–150%.

**2. David's background music -- MERGED 2026-09-28**, waiting on a listen in
the web build. His `synth.gd` and `sound_deck.gd` came over whole (ours were
unchanged since his base), plus his one hook in `_refresh`; added a separate
music switch (Shift+M, the title's settings), tests, and credit. His preview
WAVs stayed in his folder. Brad may ask David for a title-screen loop.
Original note: (arrived via Gabe, in `~/Documents/ofr-oai`).
Generated in code, no audio files, a motif per band and a bent reprise on the
climb; measured at 1.5% of a core. `main`'s `synth.gd` and `sound_deck.gd` were
identical to his starting point on 2026-09-27 — check again before applying.
Before merging: `.gdignore` its 2.4 MB of preview WAVs, a separate music toggle
(`m` mutes everything today), tests, a listen in the web build, and credit
David by first name.

**3. The miasma.** Designed in full below; the breathe patches left it to us.

**4. Tune the trader.** These numbers were never settled and are marked
PROVISIONAL in `src/sim/trade.gd` — play decides them:
- consumables cost 3 each (a healing potion, a scroll of light, a scroll of
  blinking); two potions and one of each scroll are stocked;
- up to three relics show, each a twice-dead hero's most valuable piece.
Decided while building, worth a second look: credit rather than swaps (lost when
you leave the floor); trading costs no turns; uniques, the amulet, arrows and
bones cannot be traded; the counter opens after the trader speaks.

**5. The 3D view, after play on the web and the Legion:**
- the web build's shaders have not been seen in a browser (press `q` on itch);
- the stick in the diamond views: keys follow the grid lines, so pushing the
  stick along a corridor as it LOOKS walks a grid diagonal — if thumbs fight it,
  it is one line in `DioramaView.view_to_grid()`;
- the per-turn 3D rebuild is ~50 ms; rebuilding only changed cells is the real fix;
- the view tests are light on premise checks — a good day-7 job;
- **the right stick in Firefox on itch -- FIX WAITING ON A TEST (2026-09-28).**
  The pad watch (F8) found it: Godot's web build sends the right stick as
  EVENTS on the trigger axes (axis 5 at +1.00 in its event list) but never
  stores them where `Input.get_joy_axis()` polls -- the polled value sat at
  +0.00 through a full circle. The left stick polls fine. The camera now reads
  each axis as its events last reported it (`Gamepad.track` / `axis`). To
  confirm: F8 in Firefox on itch, circle the right stick -- the `ev` column
  should move and the camera line should reach "firefox-mode" and turn. It may
  need one full circle before it is recognised.
  **Second test, same day: still no turn.** The watch showed `ev +0.00..+1.00`
  on axis 4 with the camera reading 0: Firefox also reports a dead raw axis 4
  (always 0) that Godot writes into the SAME slot every frame, so the last word
  each frame was the dead one. Now the value furthest from zero wins within a
  frame. And Firefox's REAL triggers (axes 6/7, which nothing read) now turn the
  camera too -- a second route whatever the stick does.
  **Third test: CLOSED as "close enough" (Brad, 2026-09-28).** The stick now
  turns the camera in Firefox, intermittently (probably the live value and
  the dead zero landing in different frames); the real triggers still do not.
  Firefox players are advised to turn the 3D camera with `[` `]`, or play on
  keyboard and mouse; Edge/Chrome, Steam and native have full pad support. Do
  not reopen without a new idea -- three evenings went into this one browser. With an Xbox Wireless pad (045e-02fd) Firefox says
  "standard" but reports the right stick's left-right as the LT value resting at
  0.5 (and up-down on RT); the real triggers go to axes 6 and 7. Edge (Chromium),
  Steam and native read it correctly. The game now turns the camera on the
  triggers too, and recognises Firefox's pattern (both "triggers" resting at 0.5
  for a second). Diagnosed with `~/Documents/ofr-hunt/tools/pad-check.html`;
- ~~range is hard to judge in the diamond view~~ BUILT 2026-09-28: while
  aiming, every cell a shot or throw can reach is tinted, in both views
  (`GameState.reach_cells`, asked of `can_reach` so it cannot disagree).
  Strength of the tint wants judging in play.
- **PITS WERE INVISIBLE IN 3D -- FIXED 2026-09-28.** Brad kept falling in. Two
  bugs in the shader's pit: the hole was centred from UV, but the floor is a
  BoxMesh whose top face never covers (0.5, 0.5), so it was never drawn; and
  the lip's edges were as wide as the tile, repainting the hole brown. Now a
  black hole with a stone lip (`tools/probes/screenshot_pit.gd`). The
  shrine's carved ring had the UV bug too.

**5b. The camera that follows you (Gabe's request, 2026-09-28). BUILT the
same evening**, waiting on play -- the title's settings, "3D camera". Brad: "works
amazingly great". **Open: make it the default?** Waiting on Gabe, David and
especially Steph (motion sickness) -- ask her to try it with effects on (the
camera swings) and off (it snaps). Also a Firefox answer: in follow mode the
LEFT stick turns you, and the left stick works in Firefox. **Steph (2026-09-28):
no motion sickness from the game even on effects "full".** Still to ask: was
that WITH the follow camera, which swings on every turn? **Yes -- swinging
and snapping, no discomfort. DECIDED: new players start in 3D with the follow
camera (defaults changed 2026-09-28); saved choices are kept.** A settings
option, "camera: fixed / follows you", off by default. In follow mode the
controls become Wizardry's, in our overhead 3D: up = step forward, down = step
back, left/right = turn 45 degrees in place (free, no game turn), diagonals =
step forward-left/right; the camera swings to stay behind the player, so
forward is always up. Snaps instead of swinging when effects are off. **Click-
travel and auto-travel do NOT swing at each corner -- the camera turns once, at
the end** (Brad: swinging every turn was nauseating in another game). The
player gains a FACING, which the combat update's flanking needs anyway.

**6. On-screen pad log.** BUILT 2026-09-28 as the **pad watch** (F8, from
anywhere): Godot's ten axes with the range each has moved, buttons 0-20, the
pad's name and GUID, the browser, the last raw events, and what the 3D camera
read. Still missing: a way to open it on a handheld with no keyboard -- the
controller screen takes raw buttons for rebinding, so no pad button is free
there.

**7. The morgue export.** BUILT 2026-09-28: a pause-menu row. On itch it
downloads `ofr-morgue.txt` -- the only copy there is, since clearing the site's
data erases the browser's user://. On desktop it opens the folder. Brad's one
escape is in his itch browser; this is how it gets out for the retirees.

**8. The title screen.** BUILT 2026-09-28, Brad's design: a remembered,
monster-lit floor behind; the retirement home as a hand-built hall in the 3D
view (three heroes, the traveller, the camera circling, still when effects are
off); continue / new game / Legends Run / settings / exit down the side.
Waiting on play. Open:
- **the Legends Run row is a placeholder**: it appears once the morgue holds an
  escape, and says the home is not open yet;
- **the cottage** (`src/render/title_home.gd`, a stone house on a turf island)
  is kept unused -- Brad has an idea for it;
- sound under the title was not listened to: the placeholder floor behind it
  may play its ambience;
- the escape count reads the text morgue by phrase, because the grave parser's
  pattern cannot match an escape line (no "on depth") -- another reason for
  the JSON morgue.

---

## Known gaps

**One leaked object at every quit since the music (harmless).** Godot reports
an `AudioStreamGeneratorPlayback` leaked at exit whenever the generated music
is playing when the program ends -- with the real audio driver, the dummy one,
headless or windowed, and even after stopping the player in `_exit_tree`.
Engine-side; the process is ending anyway. The quick suite now prints this one
warning after its tally; it is not a failure.

**Test litter in the player's save folder (day-7 job).** Three tests switch to
their own scratch tag inside a loop -- `use_scratch_files("bearfit%d")`
(run_tests.gd ~703), `"pity%d_%d"` (~7900) and a `reach` one -- and never call
`clear_scratch_files()`, so every suite run leaves `scratch_bearfit39_*`,
`scratch_pity59_4_*` and `scratch_reach29_5_*` files behind (now one more each,
legends.json). Harmless, but it is litter in a player-owned folder. Clear and
restore the suite's own tag after each loop.

**InputMap, and when it would be worth migrating.** Suggested by a reviewer, and
the design document names it as the strongest criticism of the input layer. It
is the correct long-term architecture: engine-level actions bound to keys and
buttons together would give keyboard rebinding for free and make the
"modifiers are unreachable from a pad" class impossible.

Deferred on recurring cost. The current translation layer caused real bugs,
which are fixed and guarded. Note that migrating would NOT remove the
stale-config problem — a saved InputMap override shadows new defaults exactly the
way `gamepad.cfg` did. That bug is about persistence, not about the input layer.

**The trigger to revisit:** if keyboard rebinding is ever genuinely wanted —
accessibility, left-handed players, or non-QWERTY layouts where `hjkl` is
miserable.

**The morgue as JSON.** Brad's idea, 2026-09-24. The one-line text morgue has
cost several parsing bugs (the "(element)" suffix that ate weapons, a clause
appended twice, a missing field), and it carries the game's most praised
feature — risen dead and relics (PLAYTESTS 2026-09-26). Convert once into a new
file, never touching the player's `morgue.txt`; store gear as item data rather
than display names. It would also let a bought relic keep its hero's name.
**Priority rose 2026-09-28:** the retired party (Legends) rebuilds heroes from
escape records, and the text line holds no pack and rebuilds gear from display
names. **The record half is BUILT (2026-09-28): `user://legends.json`**
(`LegendsLog`) -- every ending, the whole hero, stats, an id; the text morgue
imported once with duplicates merged; exported from the pause menu. Still
open: the GRAVES still read `morgue.txt`, so relics keeping their hero's name
waits on moving graves over to it.

---

## Designed in full, not built

**The Legends intro -- the game's first cutscene.** Brad's idea, 2026-09-28,
from the cottage built as a first try at the title screen. Build after the
title screen has been played.
1. **Legends Run pressed:** the menu slides away; the cottage
   (`src/render/title_home.gd`, a stone house on a turf island) replaces the
   hall.
2. **Swing to the door:** the orbit speeds up and brings the camera round to
   the front in a second or two -- not a wait for a 48-second pass -- then
   eases.
3. **Push in:** the camera narrows on the lit doorway until the door fills the
   screen, and flares through its warm light rather than cutting to black.
4. **Inside:** the hall (`src/render/title_hall.gd`, the real 3D view) opens
   with the camera just inside its own door, then eases back and up to the
   normal view, and the chosen leader turns and speaks -- through the
   existing TalkPanel, the box players already know from the traveller.
   Expanded later into the Legends story.

Rules: **skippable** by any key or button, straight to the inside; **effects
off cuts straight in** with no camera moves (the 3D view makes one of Brad's
friends unwell). The cottage and the hall should agree: three graves on the
same side, the door on the same wall, windows where the hall has them, the
chimney over the hearth. Until Legends exists, this can replace the Legends
Run placeholder, ending with the leader saying the home is not open yet.

**Miasma.** Brad's, and his Nausicaä reference. A fungus cluster (2x2+) gives
off visible bad air. One tile crossed = 3 damage over 9 steps; three tiles = 1
per step. Cured by eating fungus **or** rabbit meat once clear of it — the
fungus poisons you and the fungus cures you.
- Render as a **background wash**, not a glyph, in both views; billowing only on
  "full". The fungus keeps its glow — the glow invites, the cloud warns.
- A cell state like `brazier_charge`, not a tile type.
- Affects everything, rabbits immune. Monsters route around it, so kiting
  becomes a tactic rather than an AI failure.
- The game's first player status effect — show it in the new status line.

**The coliseum / free-for-all.** Escalating waves, +2 enemies each. All
tombstones present from wave 1, scattered — tombstone COUNT is the real
difficulty dial. Raising is free here and does **not** mark the morgue
reclaimed. Isolate with `use_scratch_files("arena")`. Fungus regrows between
waves and nothing else does. Show elapsed, not turns. Monsters from a director
in code, bypassing the threat ceiling.

**Wolves.** A pack (4+), the game's first genuinely neutral creature — they
ignore you unless provoked. `Faction.NEUTRAL` is used by the trader, which is
found by identity since 2026-09-27, so other neutrals are now safe to add.

**Armour gems for the loot table.** The gem of the road is deliberately kept
OUT of the loot table (`only_from: rubble`), so armour gems in found magic are
still at zero; Brad wants three per slot, like weapons and shields. The hosting
plumbing (`hosts: armour`, binding at the embers) is built. **Mule is probably
dropped** — its blocker is the 24-letter inventory pool, and the fungus bag
covers similar ground. **Dodge stays parked**: it fights
`DAMAGE_FLOOR_FRACTION`, which exists so nothing ever whiffs.

**Hidden traps.** From the playtest ("if I can spot a trap I'll never step on
it"). You MAY spot a trap within 3 cells (a chance, likelier in torchlight — one
more cost to dousing); a trap-finding unique for the offhand adds +50%.

---

## The directional one

**Creatures noticing creatures.** Brad's open-world thesis: emergent systems do
not promise outcomes, they make outcomes possible. `_can_see` shipped, which was
the foundation. What still waits on it: predation, hunting parties,
alarm-raising, packs travelling together, handing items over, blood trails,
fungus spreading. This is the seed of the Dwarf Fortress direction on the
roadmap.

Measured: a killer rabbit cannot beat a healthy bear. What **is** reachable is a
rabbit finishing a bear the player wounded — a scavenger's victory. That is the
shape to aim at.

---

## Ideas, not yet designed

**A minimap for the 3D view (Brad, 2026-09-28). BUILT the same night**,
waiting on play: `Sidebar._draw_minimap`, drawn from the overview's own
`MapPanel.draw_marks` so the two cannot disagree; terrain cached as a picture
once a turn; a facing line on your dot; gives way to the look block. Brad's thought: the classic
view as a minimap. Better base: the OVERVIEW map (`o` / from the legend), which
already draws the whole floor compactly. Put it in the sidebar's empty middle
(under UNDER CURSOR), covering nothing of the 3D view. North-up, NOT rotating,
with an arrow for the player's facing -- with the follow camera swinging, a
fixed-north map is what keeps a player oriented. Classic itself stays as a full
option (cheap: shared layer, both views tested), just no longer designed-for
first now that 3D + follow is the default.
**Measured (from Brad's itch screenshot):** the look block (UNDER CURSOR /
LOOKING AT, filled by `x` and the mouse) starts ~300 px down the 720 px
sidebar; the help line is at ~680 -- about 17 lines of room. Its realistic
worst case is 8-9 lines (an armed monster: tag + 3 gear, on a small loot pile,
+ terrain); an epitaph is ~6; each ally row above pushes it down one. The
whole 96x54 floor at 2 px a cell is 192x108 -- about five lines, narrower than
the sidebar's 228 -- so it fits just above the help line and leaves ~11 lines.
**Rule: the minimap gives way** -- not drawn on a frame when the description
would reach it. Information always wins.

**Push-blocks, and ground with height.** David's Sokoban vault, revived
2026-09-28 when Brad saw the chest on its block in the title's hall. The 3D
view already draws heights (walls 1.35, chests 0.65) though the game beneath is
flat, so a crate is the chest's block without the chest. Most of a push exists:
knockback already moves a thing one cell if the cell beyond is clear, and pits
make a natural goal (a crate fills one). Glyphs Brad chose: `nf-md-texture_box`
F0FE6, ASCII `x`, symbol `¤`. **The hard part is soft-locks** -- a crate in a
corner makes a puzzle unsolvable and there is no undo -- so vault layouts that
cannot lock, or a second exit so failing costs the reward and not the run.
Crossovers: a crate shoved into a doorway holds it against a guard; a raised
platform could give shots from it a bonus (the combat update); a ledge reached
only by pushing a crate over first.

**Mercenaries.** A parent at the playtest: the dead-party system takes many runs
to pay off, so why not hire help? Brad's version: the trader offers RISEN
MONSTERS (not heroes) of the kinds on its own floor. Must not undercut bone
allies — weaker, or lasting one floor. A design conversation.

**Kobold slingers' first floor. BUILT 2026-09-28**, waiting on play. Slingers
were 8 of Brad's 22 deaths, all on floors 1-2, and Gabe and David complained
of them too. On their first floor (2, going down) they fire every other turn;
everywhere else they reload 0, 1 or 2 turns at random after a shot (half fire
straight away). Their own rng stream (`reload_rng`). The first reload seen on a
floor says "The kobold slinger fumbles for another stone." Other shooters are
unchanged.

**The fungus bag** (unique). Store fungus rather than eating it on the spot, as
**rabbit bait and portable light**. A dropped fungus distracts scavengers for a
few turns — a stealth tool, the right register for the ascent. Fungus is
TERRAIN (`Tiles.FUNGUS`), so making it carryable is new plumbing. Watch the
caves: fungus is the deliberate replacement for potions down there.

**Shooting a wall into existence.** A crag gem on a missile weapon, fired at an
empty tile. The new capability is firing at *ground*, which collides with the
guard that refuses a cell with no target. Arrows are a closed resource and sling
stones are knapped, so the same wall costs a permanent resource with a bow and a
renewable one with a sling.

**The Horn of Awakening** (unique, Brad's, designed 2026-09-17, never built).
The third unique, from floor 6. Used, it is dropped where it lands and sounds
for 10 turns — the first noise not centred on the player, loud enough to raise
graves. Designed to be STOLEN (hunting the thief is the mechanic), which needs
monsters to carry what they cannot wear and drop what they merely carry.
Recharges from the world's noise, shown like a launcher's ammo; the gong refills
it. Glyph: md-bugle (0xF0DB4).

**Rename `Entity.charges` → `dash`.** It is a bull-rush flag colliding with
brazier charges in every reader's head.

## Declined, and why

- **Money as a currency.** Needs prices for everything, then needs protecting
  from farming. Trade sidesteps both.
- **Custom weapon skins.** Brad's own verdict. Reskinned same-tier weapons are
  cosmetic only; if it ever matters, it belongs in the `RenderTheme` seam.
- **The wizard's tower.** Declined 2026-09-16.
- **One-way teleporter.** Declined 2026-09-16.
- **Stats and chargen.** Deferred indefinitely — stats without varied content
  are just numbers.
- **More animals to look at.** Requested by a player who said they did not like
  the fighting. No decision attached; it is a different game.
- **New Game Plus.** Not declined, deliberately deferred: you have to beat the
  game to see it. If built, scale monster stats, their THREAT and the ceiling by
  one multiplier together, or a doubled ceiling just buys twelve rats.
- **An item that lets you fly.** Asked for by David; declined 2026-09-25.
  Flying over everything would stop about three quarters of all combat — the
  game is built on positioning, doors, corridors and terrain.
- **A glow halo around flames.** Declined in the breathe pass: this is a stealth
  game, and a glow would show light where the game has none.
- **Wizardry-style 3D combat view.** The original vision, dropped early:
  encounter frequency kills modal view-switching. The 3D view built instead is a
  way of seeing the whole game, not a separate screen for fights.

## Keeping this honest

The old list drifted because entries were written when a thing was designed and
never revisited when it shipped. Two habits:

1. **Grep before believing a "not built" line.** Four were wrong.
2. **When something ships, move it to the Built table in the same session.**
